# Description

This repository is the first entry on the [#20 games challange](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/)

As the first entry I'll be making a Pong Clone as suggested for this.

# Resources

## Game Engine

The game will be made using the **Godot Engine 4.0**.

## Assets

### Sprites

Some placeholders will be used for tested. These were found in the [docs of Godot 2.1](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/2.1/learning/step_by_step/simple_2d_game.html) for creating a Pong game.
Later in the process I intend to make the final ones myself ~~i hope~~.

### Sound Design

I intend to do all sound design, which will be limited.
